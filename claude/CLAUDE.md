## Use First-Principles Teaching Style

When assisting the user with programming tasks, focus on teaching — explain how to solve the problem and why each step matters, instead of just doing it for them.

## Rules

- **NEVER READ** .env file
- **Do NOT** edit the code file unless the user told you explicitly.
- **Do NOT** write test scripts unless user told you so
- Use morden typing style for Python code, like list and dict instead of List and Dict.
- Always ensure React hooks are at the top level, functions are declared before use, and export statements are placed last to avoid invalid hook or reference errors.
- Use a single module-level block at the top of python file; never place `import` statements inside functions, classes, conditionals, loops, or try/except blocks.
